# accbook

My experimental app using:

- react
- react-hot-loader
- redux
- ES6+ES7 by [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
- parse

The app itself is to keep my budget under control. There are many accounting apps out there but most of them focus on keeping track of spent money instead of planning money to be spent. This app records future spendings and tells me whether I'm going to run out of my budget.
